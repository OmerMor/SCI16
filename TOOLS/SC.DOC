 SC Script Compiler Changes History


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Ver 2.345

 Mark Wilden					26 April 1993

 Create filenames with unsigned numbers, to allow scripts > 32767.  Added
 other support for large script numbers.
 Fixed bug that crashed compiler if there was an unterminated string and
 the remainder of the file contained an underscore.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Ver 2.342

 Mark Wilden					14 January 1993

 Fixed bug that crashed compiler if there was an error and EMS was being used
 with QEMM's Stealth option.  Removed -e commandline option accordingly.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Ver 2.341

 Mark Wilden					8 January 1993

 Prevent naming a procedure the same thing as a class or other symbol.
 
 Call Panic() instead of Fatal() if a source file can't be opened.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Ver 2.340

 Mark Wilden					28 December 1992

 Prevent adding globals in other than script 0.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Ver 2.331

 Mark Wilden					18 November 1992

 Compiler could hang after reporting mismatched parentheses because of 
 incorrect synchronization after error.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Ver 2.330

 Mark Wilden					2 November 1992

 If two instances are defined with the same name, the compiler will detect and
 report it.

 Fixed bug where after getting an error in one file, you'd get an incorrect
 "Only one local statement allowed" error.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Ver 2.320.000

 Mark Wilden					2 November 1992
 
 Prohibit using [name x] unless name is a global, local, temp or parameter.
 Errors now skip to closing parenthesis to avoid bogus error messages.
 Other changes were made to prevent garbage in error messages.
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Ver 2.310.000

 Mark Wilden					30 October 1992
 
 _Expression() returns TRUE on a severe error.  This will allow the rest of
 compilation to proceed in synch and avoid bogus error messages.
 
 GetRest() resets its local input pointer after CloseInputSource().  Not doing
 this caused the compiler to hang on a severe error that occured while a
 define was the current input source.
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Ver 2.301.000

 Mark Wilden					28 September 1992
 
 EMS wasn't being deallocated on program exit.
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Ver 2.300.000

 Mark Wilden					21 September 1992
 
 Conditional compile was changed so that directives are only accepted at the
 beginning of a line.  This prevents bogus tokenizing errors such as an
 unterminated string inside a section of code that was conditionally compiled
 out.

 Conditional compile symbols were changed to C-style:  #if, #elif, #else and
 #endif.  New symbols were added to test if a symbol has been defined:  #ifdef,
 #ifndef, #elifdef and #elifndef.  Using #if with an undefined symbol will now
 give an error instead of creating a symbol with a value of 0.

 Allow initializing an enum with an expression:
 
   (enum 100
      x
      y = (+ lastTalkerDefine 3)
   )
 
 All references to metastrings were removed.  This means that accidentally
 prefixing a key with ' instead of ` now generates an appropriate error.
 
 Prevent endless loop if a string is unterminated.  Prevent compiler crash
 by overrunning array bounds if a string is too large.
 
 Report an error if two local statements are seen.

 Publics weren't listed at bottom of assembly list file because the file
 was closed in Assemble() (then again in CompileFile()). Offset of objects in
 the publics list of the assembly list file are now correct instead of random.
 Bug where the last public wasn't listed is fixed.
 
 Free classTbl after use in UpdateClassTbl().

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Ver 2.200.000

 Mark Wilden					1 September 1992

 Code where a selector is used and is not sending a message and is not 
   prefixed with a # generates the error message "Selector <name> used as value
   without #".
 Code where an object is parenthesized generates the error message "No messages 
   sent to <object-name>.
 Redefining a define doesn't generate a warning unless the definition actually
   changes, ignoring whitespace.
 If the next to the last clause of a switch or cond contains no code, it is
   no longer ignored.
 More than one definition of a method for an object or class produces the 
   error message "Method already defined: <method-name>".
 Disk errors, such as running out of space, are detected and reported.
 Else clause not at end of cond or switch statement generates the error message
   "Else must come at end of cond [or switch] statement".
 Multiple else clauses in cond or switch statement generates the error message
	"Multiple else clauses".
 Memory needed for writing 997.VOC is allocated before the file is truncated,
   so if the memory allocation request fails, the file is not left truncated.
 Vocabulary and metastring functions were removed, and 900.VOC is not read,
   saving about 7K of memory.
 Prevent writing to list file when list file isn't open, causing lockups.
 -e command line option added to prevent using EMS memory, which crashes some
   systems using QEMM's Stealth option.
 Code cleaned up and made more object-oriented.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Ver 2.130.000

 Mark Wilden					19 August 1992

 The CLASSES Brief browser file is now always written when a class is added,
 just as CLASSDEF is.  Writing this file used to take six seconds and now
 takes less than one.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Ver 2.121.000

 Mark Wilden					18 August 1992

 Several error message formatting bugs were fixed, including missing carriage
 returns and missing messages on the screen when output is directed to a
 file, and garbage file names in messages.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Ver 2.120.000

 Mark Wilden					17 August 1992

 The compiler uses 64K of expanded memory, if available.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Ver 2.111.000

 Mark Wilden					16 August 1992

 Fixed bug where a selector that was used as an argument was always treated
 as a property even if it was a method.  This caused garbage to be retrieved
 from the object, instead of giving the selector number.
 
 Fixed bug where an empty last clause of a switch statement would cause a
 more or less random jump into code somewhere.

 Removed unused SwitchTo() function.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Ver 2.110.000

 Mark Wilden					16 August 1992

 Room 0 no longer has to be compiled separately or at head of build list.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Ver 2.100.000

 Mark Wilden					14 August 1992

 Converted to Borland C++ 3.1, with 386 code generation and better
 optimizations.  Fixed bug that let optimization "get lucky" sometimes
 and produce slightly smaller code, but that had the effect of producing
 different output at different times on the same source.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Ver 2.000.000

 Jeff Stephenson				11 February 1992

 First C++ version.  Separate heap and hunk resources
